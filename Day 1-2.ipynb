    "__SyntaxError__\n",

    "- You have forgotten to put a colon (:) at the end of a def/if/for line - You have different numbers of open and close brackets\n",
    "\n",
    "__TypeError__\n",
    "- You are trying to use an operator on wrong type of object\n",
    "- You have used non-integer numbers when slicing a list\n",
    "- An object you expect to have a value is actually None\n",
    "- You have called a method or function with the wrong number or type of arguments (input to a function).\n",
    "\n",
    "__Indentation Error__\n",
    "- You have used a mixture of tabs and spaces\n",
    "- You have not indented all lines in a block equally\n",
    "- You have not indented when Python expects you to\n",

    "- You have forgotten to define a variable\n",
    "- You have misspelt a variable, function or method name\n",
    "- You have forgotten to import a module or a package\n",
    "- Your code uses a variable outside the scope (e.g. within the function) where it is defined\n",
    "- Your code calls a function before it has been defined\n",
    "- You are trying to print a single word and have forgotten the quotation marks\n",
    "\n",
    "__IOError__\n",
    "- You are trying to open a file that doesn’t exist - You are in the wrong directory\n",
